1/2 stick | 60g | butter
teaspoon | ts | salt
2 tablespoons  | 2Ts | sugar
1 cup | 150g | flour
4 | 4 | eggs

- boil all without flour + eggs
- take off heat
- miz dough at once
- dry the dough a bit on heat
- mix 4 (or more) eggs, one at the time with a wooden spatula. it's fun: at first the egg makes the dough very slippery and when mixing all of a sudden it glues together.
- put dough in a plastic bag, cut a hole in a corner and make little piles.
- put pearl sugar on top

- 200 gC = 380 gF for 15 minutes, then
