g | Night Before
1/2 cup | warm water
1 tablespoon | active-dry yeast
1/2 cup | melted butter
2 cups | whole or 2% milk
1 teaspoon | salt
2 tablespoons | sugar (optional)
3 cups | all-purpose flour

g | The Next Day
2 | large eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon | baking soda

- Combine the yeast and the water in a large mixing bowl and let stand for a few minutes.
- Combine the butter with the milk, salt, and sugar (if using). Test with your finger to make sure the mixture has cooled to luke warm, then stir it into the dissolved yeast mixture.
- Add the flour and stir until a thick, shaggy dough is formed and there is no more visible flour.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter overnight. The batter will double or triple in bulk as it rises.
- The next morning, beat the eggs together and add them to the batter along with the baking soda. Using a whisk or hand blender, beat the eggs and baking soda into the batter until completely combined.
