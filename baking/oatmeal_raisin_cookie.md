- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, and baking soda; set aside.

- Stir in the oats, and raisins. Cover and chill dough for one hour to overnight.
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
- Use a cookie scoop (two tablespoons) to drop balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
- Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.
- Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.
