# Yogurt cake

From Mengian, Mike Peterson's wife

Ingredients | for 12 mini cakes
--- | ---
4 | eggs |
¾ cup | plain yogurt
¼ cup | cake flour
1/3 cup | sugar
3 Tbsp | melted butter

1. Separate egg yolks and egg whites. Preheat oven to 300F.
2. Mix egg yolk, yogurt with a whisk.
3. Sift flour into egg yolk mixture.
4. Add butter to the batter and fold it until smooth.
5. Beat the egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks.
6. Fold the beaten egg whites to the batter.
7. Divide the batter mixture into a muffin pan lined with muffin linings, knock the muffin pan on the counter
to release the big air bubbles.
8. Bake for 25mins and let it cool down. Taste the best when served chill.
Tips:
1. If the yogurt you’re using has sugar, be mindful decrease the amount of sugar you’re adding in. General
this recipe requires 70g sugar in total.
2. Don’t over mix the butter in step 6, as the result will create gluten and deflate air bubbles from the egg
whites.
3. It is normal the cake deflates a lot when cool down.
