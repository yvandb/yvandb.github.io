- zeer goed. Voeg beetje meer zout toe.
- Was verbrand aan onderkant. Bakplaat moet misschien niet voorverwarmd zijn.

- 2 nachten en 1 portie 3 nachten

- poolish 50% bread flour / 50% whole wheat flour
- 1 batch 30% spelt
- other batch 20% whole wheat 10% rye
- 10% extra water
- was good but not as good as pure breadflour
- smelled a bit like poolish -> too strong so maybe just all breadflour for poolish
