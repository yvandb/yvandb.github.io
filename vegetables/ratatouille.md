# Ratatouille

```
bell peppers
eggplant
fennel
zucchini
tomato paste (optional)
grated parmesan (optional)
herbes de provence
olive oil
salt
```

## Steps
- roast bell peppers until black and remove skin (most annoying part of recipe)
- cut fennel and pre-roast for 5 mins (with salt and olive oil), let cool 
- cut rest of vegs in bite size pieces (use a mandoline for the zucchini)
- keep vegs separated and put some olive oil on them, season with salt and a generous amount of herbes de provence
- in a baking pan, spread out some tomato paste
- arrange row-by-row of vegs. it helps when you slant the baking pan a bit to make gravity works for you instead of against
- bake for ~25 mins in 380 degree oven. the eggplant is the best test for doneness
- spread some grated cheese on top for the last 5 minutes. dependent on your over it needs some broiling to turn brown and crunchy
